YouTube Case Study
📌 Introduction
This project analyzes YouTube comments and video data using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Data Visualization techniques. The goal is to extract insights from user interactions, engagement metrics, and trending content.
📊 Analysis Performed
1️⃣ Sentiment AnalysisObjective: Determine the sentiment of YouTube comments.
Methodology:
The sentiment polarity is measured on a scale of -1 to 1.
-1 → Negative Sentiment
0 → Neutral Sentiment
1 → Positive Sentiment
Added a polarity column to store the sentiment scores for each comment.
2️⃣ WordCloud AnalysisObjective: Identify the most frequently used words in positive and negative comments.
Methodology:
Created word clouds for positive and negative comments separately.
Removed stop words (e.g., "is", "that", "the") to focus on meaningful words.
3️⃣ Emoji AnalysisObjective: Analyze emoji usage in YouTube comments.
Methodology:
Extracted emojis from comment text.
Counted the frequency of each emoji.
Created a bar graph using Plotly to visualize emoji usage.
4️⃣ Most Liked CategoriesObjective: Identify which YouTube categories receive the most likes.
Methodology:
Collected video data from multiple countries.
Merged all datasets into a single dataset.
Created a boxplot to analyze the distribution of likes per category.
5️⃣ Engagement AnalysisObjective: Measure user engagement with videos.
Methodology:
Calculated like rate, dislike rate, and comment count rate based on views.
Analyzed correlation between views and engagement metrics.
6️⃣ Trending ChannelsObjective: Identify the most trending YouTube channels.
Methodology:
Grouped data by channel title.
Counted the number of trending videos per channel.
Created a barplot showing the top trending channels.
7️⃣ Impact of Punctuation on Views & LikesObjective: Check if punctuation in video titles impacts engagement.
Methodology:
Counted the number of punctuation marks in video titles.
Created boxplots to analyze the relationship between punctuation count and views/likes.
